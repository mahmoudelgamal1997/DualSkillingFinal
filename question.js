//q1 - what is return type of keyword async function 
// answer is : promise  

//q2 - what are falsy in js 
// answers is 
/*
 - false value in js is false 
 - Nan : Not a number represent an non mathemtical value like 
 const result = "Hello" / 2;
console.log(result); // Output: NaN   

   - undefined : represent a value not assigned yet 
   - null : absence of object value 
   -  0 : the number of zero 
*/

/*
Q3-  
Primitive are : String - Number - undefined - null - Boolean 

non-Primitive are : Object - array - Function -Date-Map-Set
*/



/* Q4- what  is Hoisting 

- it's call variable before declare it 
*/

/* q5 - Different between let ,var ,const ?

    const can't be change over compile time
    different between let and var  in scope : 
        let is block scope 
        var is function scope is hoisting
*/

/*
Q6- what are type in function and which is hoisted

- function declaration is hoisted
- function expression  not hoisted
- arrow function  not hoisted

*/

/*
Q7- JS is sync or async ?

--JavaScript itself is single-threaded and synchronous, meaning it executes one operation at a time in a single sequence. However, JavaScript also has mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations, allowing it to perform tasks such as making network requests, reading files, or handling user input without blocking the execution of the main thread.

Asynchronous JavaScript:
Event Loop:
Behind the scenes, JavaScript relies on an event loop to handle asynchronous operations. The event loop continuously checks the message queue for messages (events) and processes them one at a time.
The main thread is responsible for executing synchronous code and handling events from the message queue.
*/

/*
Q8- what is the role of Event Loop in js 
Event loop is responsible for handling asynchronous operations. 
it checks the messages.

*/



/*
Q9- differ between === and == 
=== is restrict equal and check also the type 
== is only check the false value 
*/

/*
Q10- what is NAN is js ?
Nan is not a number like     "test"/20

*/



/*
Q11- What is scope and scope chain 

- the scope are local scope, function scope and global scope.
- scope chain is the process of searching for variable in multi scopes.
*/


/* Q12- what is closure
Closures allow a function to access variables from its outer (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished executing.
